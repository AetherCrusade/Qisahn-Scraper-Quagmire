# Qisahn-Scraper-Quagmire
My first attempt at using BeautifulSoup.  
Scrapes Qisahn.com for Nintendo Switch Games.  
  
Written in Python 3, outputs the data into a CSV file.  
BeautifulSoup will act as a Mozilla Browser to access the website information.  
Yes, I am aware than my programming style is very unconventional, but hey that's what makes me unique.

### Prerequisites:
* Python 3 (Who the hell doesn't have python these days)

## Purpose
I wanted to learn the BeautifulSoup library.  
Also, I thought it would be pretty cool.

## Licensing
The script is licensed under the MIT License.

## Special Thanks
Authors of all libraries / modules used in the development of this script, in no particular order:
* BeautifulSoup - HTML parsing.
